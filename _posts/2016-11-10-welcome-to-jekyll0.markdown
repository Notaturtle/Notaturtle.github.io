The arrival of spring means the arrival of strawberries (yum!), but these sweet berries aren't just loaded with antioxidants: A new report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) found that a single sample of strawberries contained 13 different pesticides. Not so yum.

In late 2012, the Environmental Protection Agency canceled the use of the go-to, cancer-causing strawberry pesticide methyl iodide in the US. But keeping that chemical off of the US market doesn't mean strawberries are completely in the clear. Growers of nonorganic strawberries in California—where nearly 90% of the nation's strawberries are produced—continue to pump hazardous substances into fields.
