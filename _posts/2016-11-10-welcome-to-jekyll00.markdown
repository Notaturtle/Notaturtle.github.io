High in fiber, potassium and vitamins A and K, blueberries pack a nutritional punch. Unfortunately, in some cases they can have side effects, including gastrointestinal distress, hypoglycemia and an increased risk of bleeding if you are taking some prescription medications. If you're healthy, eating blueberries as part of a balanced diet is not likely to cause side effects. However, if you have an underlying health condition, check with your doctor before adding them to your diet.
